## üóÇÔ∏è How Nextflow Components Are Structured

### 1. Processes

Defined as blocks inside the .nf script.
Each process encapsulates a task (e.g., running FastQC, trimming reads).
Example:

```
process fastqc {
  input:
  file reads from fastq_files

  output:
  file "*.html" into qc_results

  script:
  """
  fastqc $reads
  """
}
```

### 2. Channels

Also defined in the same .nf file.
They are used to pass data between processes.
Example:

```
fastq_files = Channel.fromPath('data/*.fastq')
```

### 3. Operators

Used to transform or filter channels.
Example:

```
filtered_files = fastq_files.filter { it.name.endsWith('.fastq') }
```

### 4. Configurations

Typically placed in a separate file called nextflow.config.
This file defines resources, containers, and execution profiles.
Example nextflow.config:

```
process {
  cpus = 4
  memory = '8 GB'
  container = 'biocontainers/fastqc'
}

profiles {
  local {
    executor = 'local'
  }
  cluster {
    executor = 'slurm'
  }
}
```

### Summary

| Component | Location | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Process | main.nf | Defines a task |
| Channel | main.nf | Passes data between tasks |
| Operator | main.nf | Transforms channel data |
| Configuration | nextflow.config | Sets resources, containers, profiles |
